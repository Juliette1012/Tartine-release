Release of a game created during the Global Game Jam 2020

# Presentation GGJ

A `Game jam` is a tournament in which everyone can participate alone or in team to create a game in a certain amount of time, most of the time from scratch.
At the end of the jam, each game is posted on the jam website and everyone can try, grade and give some feedbacks about each game.

The `Global Game Jam` is one of the biggest and most famous game jam around the world. Last year, it hosted teams in more than 850 sites in 113 countries and generated 9000 games in one weekend.

# Presentation of the project

The theme of 2020 Global Game Jam was  `repair`, so each team had to make a **game** on this theme in `48 hours`.  

I worked in team with **4** friends of mine and we directly thought about a destroyed robot that needs to find his parts to repair itself and go through different levels.  

Each part of the robot unlock a new hability to pass some obstacles.  

With that, the idea of `Nono the tiny robot` was born.
